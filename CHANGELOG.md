# Changelog

<!-- <START NEW CHANGELOG ENTRY> -->
## 0.7.0 (June XX, 2024)
* Converted to a Jupyter Lab 4.0+ compatible plugin.
* Renamed to JPSL Instructor Tools (JPSLInstructorTools) to better reflect 
  the tight integration with Jupyter Physical Science Lab.
* Added capability to enable and disable the Instructor Tools menu as well 
  as show and hide it , so that this plugin can exist in a Jupyter Hub 
  installation used by both the instructor and students. By default, the menu 
  is deactivated and will not activate if a student has a notebook set to 
  disallow use of instructor tools.
* Added boilerplate instructions for creating a pdf of notebook with 
  collapsed headings.
